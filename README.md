# Goal

Change the target number as follows:

1. Edit `main.c`.
1. Find the definition for `GOAL`.
1. Change the value for `GOAL`.
1. Save `main.c`.

# Build

Build the `main` program as follows:

1. Ensure development tools are installed (`gcc`).
1. Change into the `sequential` directory.
1. Type: `make`

# Run

Run the program as follows:

`./main`

# Output

When the program finds an expression whose value equals `GOAL`, it will write
that expression to the console (standard output).

# Terminate

The program will not terminate until it finds a valid expression.

Press `^C` to end the program at any time.
